Connect to your Subsonic server and listen to your music wherever you go. Songs
are cached for playback to save on your mobile bandwidth and to make them
available when you have no connection at all.

Subsonic is a cross-platform FOSS media server that's capable of indexing very
large media collections. The server can transcode if necessary so that the app
can play files that your device may not normally support.
